# ✅ Double-Encoding HTML Fix - COMPLETED

## 🎯 Problem Resolved
**Issue**: Double-encoding in minishell documentation website causing malformed HTML like:
```html
code-keyword">else "code-keyword">if (ft_strcmp(argv[0], "pwd") == 0)
```

## 🔧 Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced CodeHighlighter Class
**File**: `js/custom.js`
- **Fixed keyword replacement logic**: Now splits content by existing spans to avoid processing inside them
- **Improved string/comment handling**: Uses same span-aware splitting technique
- **Added prevention logic**: Skips re-highlighting already processed content
- **Enhanced cleanup function**: Fixes specific double-encoding patterns

### 2. Comprehensive Cleanup Functions
- **`cleanupDoubleEncoding()`**: Fixes nested spans and malformed HTML
- **`cleanupHTML()`**: Completely resets and re-highlights all content
- **`debugEncodingIssues()`**: Detects and reports encoding problems

### 3. Automated Fix Scripts
**Files**: `fix_encoding.sh`, `cleanup_html.sh`
- **Batch processing**: Fixes all HTML files automatically
- **Pattern detection**: Uses sed to find and fix common encoding issues
- **Comprehensive reporting**: Shows which files were processed and fixed

### 4. Test and Debug Tools
**Files**: `test_syntax.html`, `test_fix.html`, `final_test.html`
- **Interactive testing**: Browser-based debugging interface
- **Automated verification**: Tests for common encoding patterns
- **Real-time debugging**: Console functions for immediate issue detection

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Root Cause
The JavaScript syntax highlighter was applying highlighting multiple times to the same content, creating nested spans when keywords appeared adjacent to each other.

### Key Fixes
1. **Span-aware processing**: Split content by existing spans before applying new highlighting
2. **Content detection**: Check for existing highlighting before processing
3. **Pattern-specific cleanup**: Target the exact malformed patterns reported
4. **Comprehensive reset**: Complete highlighting reset and reapplication

### Browser Integration
```javascript
// Available in browser console:
MinishellDocs.debugEncodingIssues()  // Detect issues
MinishellDocs.cleanupHTML()          // Fix all issues
```

## 📊 Verification Results
- ✅ No double-encoding patterns detected in HTML files
- ✅ Syntax highlighting working correctly
- ✅ Cleanup functions operational
- ✅ Debug tools functional
- ✅ All test pages passing
